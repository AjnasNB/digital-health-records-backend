# Digital Health Records - Backend System

A comprehensive backend system for digitizing, processing, and managing healthcare records with AI-powered document analysis, verification, and structured data extraction.

## 🚀 Overview

Digital Health Records is designed to solve one of the biggest challenges in Indian healthcare: the conversion of handwritten medical records into structured, accessible digital formats. The system uses advanced AI technologies including:

- **Google Document AI** for extracting text from various medical document types
- **RetellAI** for automated patient verification calls
- **Groq AI** for intelligent data processing and structuring

By combining these technologies, we create a reliable pipeline that ensures high accuracy in the digitization process.

## 🔄 Workflow Pipeline

Our system follows a comprehensive workflow to ensure accuracy and reliability:

1. **Document Upload**: Healthcare providers upload handwritten or digital medical records
2. **Document Processing**: Google Document AI extracts text from documents
3. **Patient Verification**: RetellAI makes automated calls to verify extracted information
4. **Intelligent Analysis**: Groq AI processes verified data into structured formats
5. **Secure Storage**: Verified health records are securely stored in MongoDB

## 🛠️ Key Technologies

- **Backend Framework**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI Services**:
  - Google Document AI - OCR and document processing
  - Groq AI - Natural language processing
  - RetellAI - Voice-based verification
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for document storage
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## 📋 API Endpoints

### User Management
- `POST /api/users/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/users/login` - Authenticate and get token
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Get current user profile

### Health Records
- `POST /api/health-records` - Upload and process a new health record
- `GET /api/health-records` - Get all health records for a user
- `GET /api/health-records/:id` - Get specific health record
- `GET /api/health-records/:id/full` - Get detailed health record with all processing data
- `POST /api/health-records/:id/verify` - Initiate verification call
- `GET /api/health-records/:id/verify/status` - Check verification status

## 🔐 Security

- JWT-based authentication for all API endpoints
- Role-based access control (patient vs healthcare provider)
- Secure document storage with AWS S3
- Data encryption for sensitive medical information
- Request validation and sanitization

## 🔌 Service Integrations

### Document AI Service

The `documentAIService.js` module handles all interactions with Google Document AI, including:
- Batch processing of multi-page documents
- Single-file scanning with different processor types
- Support for both handwritten and printed documents
- Mock data generation for testing

### Groq Service

The `groqService.js` module leverages Groq's high-performance LLM to:
- Extract structured data from raw document text
- Identify medical entities (diagnoses, medications, procedures)
- Generate patient summaries
- Determine document types and categories

### Retell Service

The `retellService.js` module manages patient verification through:
- Automated verification call initiation
- Transcript processing from completed calls
- Status tracking and management
- Conversation management with AI assistants

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- MongoDB
- Google Cloud account with Document AI enabled
